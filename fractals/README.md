Nicholas Eterovic, 2021Q1.

Who doesn't love a fractal? Famous examples include the Mandelbrot Set, Koch Snowflake, Sierpinski Triangle, and the Menger Sponge. The last has special significance for me; in the first year of my undergraduate studies I volunteered to help build the MegaMenger - a record-breaking level-4 Menger Sponge constructed from 960,000 business cards. This global endeavour was the joint effort of 20 universities, each building a level-3 Sponge to then ship to the UK for final assembly by crane. I am proud knowing that my level-2 contribution is nestled in its heart.

This project aims to illustrate the beauty of fractals via self-similar space-filling curves. In other words, how recursively interpolating a piece-wise-linear path yields unpredictable and sometimes beautiful patterns.

Thank you to maths communicator Matt Parker for organizing the MegaMenger project and kindling my interest in fractal theory. Your Standup Maths content continues to be engaging and inspiring even after almost a decade.

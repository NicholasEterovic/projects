Nicholas Eterovic, 2020Q4.

This is a hobby project that spun out of my learning to solve a Rubik's cube. Often, the best way to solidify an understanding is to teach it to others; the code here is my lesson to the machine. It became apparent that, before implementing the solution, I first had to define a Rubik's cube - to model the pieces, faces, and rotations. My approach is to encode the cube's stickers in a three-dimensional vector space. This allows for rotations (of a face or the whole cube) via matrix multiplication.

I'm always interested in alternative solutions. This code is open to your comments and inspiration.

Nicholas Eterovic, 2020Q4.

In the summer of 2020 I picked up tennis with a friend of mine. Fortunately, we both had played during childhood - we had the muscle memory but our skill was rusty. Our plan was to play at least once per week, encouraged by the progress that we made with each session. However, tennis courts in NYC are in high demand and many are prohibitively expensive to book. Restricted to peak hours by our work commitments, we searched creatively for available courts for an affordable price - landing on the Riverside Clay Tennis Association (RCTA), which offers free bookings via their website on a first-come first-served basis. Each day, at a random time in the morning, courts become available to be reserved with only a few clicks: selecting a court number, choosing a time, entering som credentials, and clicking confirm. It is so easy, in fact, that the courts are fully booked in seconds! Hundreds of optimistic tennis players compete for a few dozen slots, making it a game of lightning-fast reflexes to secure a session. Automating the process was my way to crush the competition.
